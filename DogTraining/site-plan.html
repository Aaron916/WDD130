      <h3>Training Tips</h3>
      <h5>Sit</h5>
      <p>
        Teaching a dog to sit can be easy for some dogs, and difficult for others. 
        If your dog is naturally inclined to sit while idle, he will be able to pick up doing on command quickly.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Get some delicious training treats.</li>
        <li>Give the command: "Sit".</li>
        <li>Wait for your dog to sit.</li>
        <li>praise and reward.</li>
        <li>Increase difficulty by waiting longer between them sitting and getting a reward.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If your dog takes a long time to sit after you give them the command, dont worry! 
        Wait patiently, dont repeat the command too quickly. If more than 30 seconds has passed, try again. 
        If after three times youve given the command and waited and he still hasn't sat, redirect your puppy to something else for a short period, and try again. 
        Once your puppy gets it the first time, they'll get it quicker the second, third, and fourth time.
      </p>
      <h5>Stay</h5>
      <P>Just like with sit, this command will be easier for some dogs than others. Patience is key!</P>
      <ul>
        <li>Get some delicious treats.</li>
        <li>Stand close to your dog, facing him directly.</li>
        <li>Give the command: "stay".</li>
        <li>Take a step back.</li>
        <li>Wait a second.</li>
        <li>Step forward, praise and reward.</li>
        <li>Increase difficulty by steping farther away, and/or turning around and walking away.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If your dog continues to follow you when you take the first step, try taking a smaller step, or a fake step.
        Increase difficulty further by leaving the treat in front of him and stepping back. Give them an additional, higher quality treat when you step forward if you do this method.
