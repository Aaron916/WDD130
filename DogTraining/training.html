                    <h5>Sit</h5>
                    <p>
                        Teaching a dog to sit can be easy for some dogs, and
                        difficult for others.
                        If your dog is naturally inclined to sit while idle, he
                        will
                        be able to pick up doing on command quickly.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Get some delicious training treats.</li>
                        <li>Give the command: "Sit".</li>
                        <li>Wait for your dog to sit.</li>
                        <li>praise and reward.</li>
                        <li>Increase difficulty by waiting longer between them
                            sitting and getting a reward.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        If your dog takes a long time to sit after you give them
                        the
                        command, dont worry!
                        Wait patiently, dont repeat the command too quickly. If
                        more
                        than 30 seconds has passed, try again.
                        If after three times youve given the command and waited
                        and
                        he still hasn't sat, redirect your puppy to something
                        else
                        for a short period, and try again.
                        Once your puppy gets it the first time, they'll get it
                        quicker the second, third, and fourth time.

                    <h5>Stay</h5>
                    <P>Just like with sit, this command will be easier for some
                        dogs than others. Patience is key!</P>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Get some delicious treats.</li>
                        <li>Stand close to your dog, facing him directly.</li>
                        <li>Give the command: "stay".</li>
                        <li>Take a step back.</li>
                        <li>Wait a second.</li>
                        <li>Step forward, praise and reward.</li>
                        <li>Increase difficulty by steping farther away, and/or
                            turning around and walking away.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If your dog continues to follow you when you take the
                        first step, try taking a smaller step, or a fake step.
                        Increase difficulty further by leaving the treat in
                        front of him and stepping back. Give them an additional,
                        higher quality treat when you step forward if you do
                        this method.
